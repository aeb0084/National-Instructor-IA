## Abstract: 

"Traditional biology curricula depict science as an objective field, overlooking the important influence that human values and biases have on what is studied and who can be a scientist. We can address this shortcoming by incorporating Ideological Awareness (IA) into the curriculum, which is an understanding of biases, stereotypes, and assumptions that shape contemporary and historical science. We surveyed a national sample of lower-level biology instructors to determine their views of the (1) purpose of biology education, (2) value of IA in biology, and (3) hesitations to teaching IA in biology. Most instructors reported that “understanding the world” was the main goal of biology education. Despite the perceived benefits of IA, such as increasing student engagement and dispelling misconceptions, instructors were hesitant to implement IA modules due to potential professional consequences. We address how instructor values, purpose, and hesitancies affect teaching practices, and propose systemic approaches to increasing instructor support."
